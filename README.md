# Simple-Linear-Regression

### Hello everyone!

Today I am going to build my first machine learning alogrithm which a simple linear regression model.....


### So what is linear regression?

--Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.

--It is the easiest alogrithm among all machine learning agorithm.

--Its quite simple to implement.


### About Dataset

--Here I am using a simple dataset from kaggle which is Weights and Heights dataset tried to apply linear regression algorithm.

--The data contains the variables

####   --Gender

####   --Height (m)

####   --Weight (kg)

### Goal
  -> Predict the height or weight of a person.
